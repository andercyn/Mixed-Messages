# Codecademy "Mixed Messages" Project

## Introduction
The "Mixed Messages" project on Codecademy challenges students to create a JavaScript program that will generate a random message each time a user runs the program. The random messages should be comprised of at least three separate components.

My program will generate random predictions about how the user should behave using the following categories:
1. a predictive word (i.e. "should" or "will")
2. a verb, and
3. a noun

Each category will have eight entries, for a potential 512 message permutations. 

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- HTML

## Current Status
Basic functionality for generating a message has been completed and can be run through Node.js. An HTML UI is currently under development. 

Potential future functionality:
- CSS style sheet for the HTML page
- list a history of previous messages
