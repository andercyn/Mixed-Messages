# Codecademy "Mixed Messages" Project

## Introduction
The "Mixed Messages" project on Codecademy challenges students to create a JavaScript program that will generate a random message each time a user runs the program. The random messages should be comprised of at least three separate components.

My program will generate random predictions about how the user should behave using the following categories:
1. a predictive word (i.e. "should" or "will")
2. a verb, and
3. a noun

Each category will have eight entries, for a potential 512 message permutations. 

## Technologies
The program will be written in JavaScript and run through Node.js.

## Current Status
Under development.
